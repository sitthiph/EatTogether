# GrubTogether
Using the EatStreet.com API, we created an easy way to order within a group setting without everyone having to be in the same place and all share the same device to place the order. All you have to do is to visit the website to create a new order, which will generate a grub-key that you can distribute to anyone who wants to go into the order. For example, if someone were to create an order and the key generate is "ja82n5-o891023", all I would have to do is go into the website, log in with the grub-key and select the food I would like to purchase. This will be added to the group order which is displayed on the dashboard of the website.
